## How We Do Tasks

1. **Check the Todo List**: Before starting any task, always check the Todo list to see your assigned task.

2. **Branch Creation**: 
   - Create a new branch for your task. 
   - Name your branch following this convention: `feature/(name_of_task)`.
   - Make sure to base your branch off the `develop` branch.

3. **Merge Request**:
   - Once you have completed your task, send a merge request from your feature branch to the `develop` branch.
   - Your merge request will be reviewed for bugs and any necessary adjustments before merging.

4. **Deleting Feature Branch**:
   - After the merge is approved and completed, your feature branch will be deleted automatically.

## Documentation and Tutorials
- For any tutorials or documentation related to your tasks, I will create issues under your assigned tasks in the issue tracker.
- **Important**: **DO NOT CLOSE THIS ISSUE!** It will automatically close once it's marked in the "done" category in the Todo.
